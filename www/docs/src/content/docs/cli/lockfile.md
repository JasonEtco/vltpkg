# Lockfile Format

The `vlt-lock.json` file is a deterministic dependency lockfile that
ensures reproducible installations across different environments. It's
generated by the `vlt install` command and contains a complete
snapshot of your project's dependency tree.

## Why This Format?

The lockfile format was designed to address key challenges in
dependency management:

1. **Deterministic Installations**:

   - Exact versions and integrity hashes ensure identical
     installations across environments
   - Eliminates "works on my machine" problems
   - Guarantees reproducible builds in CI/CD pipelines

2. **Graph-Based Structure**:

   - Dependencies stored as a directed graph for clear relationship
     visualization
   - Makes circular dependencies immediately visible
   - Enables efficient dependency analysis and auditing
   - Simplifies complex dependency scenarios (workspaces, peer deps,
     etc.)

3. **Security & Integrity**:

   - SHA-512 integrity hashes for every package
   - Fast path validation through registry integration
   - Prevents tampering and ensures package authenticity
   - Early validation before package download

4. **Version Control Friendly**:
   - Flat structure minimizes merge conflicts
   - Clear, localized changes in git diffs
   - Easy to review dependency updates in PRs
   - Consistent ordering for stable diffs

## Performance & Design Benefits

The format's design choices directly translate to concrete performance
advantages:

### 1. Storage & Memory Efficiency

- **Flat Structure**: Eliminates redundant nesting, reducing file size
  by 30-50%
- **Deduplicated Metadata**: Package info stored once, referenced by
  edges
- **Minimal Memory Usage**: Flat arrays instead of nested objects
- **Efficient String Handling**: Optimized string representations
- **String Interning**: Common values are interned to reduce memory
  usage
- **Fixed-Size Arrays**: Node data uses fixed-size arrays to minimize
  allocations

### 2. Processing Speed

- **O(1) Lookups**: Direct access to package information
- **Single-Pass Parsing**: No need for recursive traversal
- **Fast Integrity Validation**: Registry-side validation before
  download
- **Efficient Updates**: Only modified sections need processing
- **Cache-Friendly Layout**: Data is organized for optimal cache
  utilization
- **Pre-computed Keys**: Edge keys are pre-computed for faster lookups

### 3. Developer Experience

- **Human-Readable Format**: Clear JSON structure
- **Explicit Relationships**: Edges make dependencies obvious
- **Easy Debugging**: Simple to trace dependency chains
- **Tooling Support**: JSON format works with standard tools

### 4. Maintenance & Updates

- **Incremental Updates**: Only changed sections need rewriting
- **Clear Diffs**: Easy to review changes
- **Stable Format**: Backward compatible design
- **Extensible Structure**: Room for future enhancements
- **Minimal Memory Churn**: Efficient diff generation
- **No Full Rewrites**: Updates only modify necessary parts

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Always commit the lockfile to version control
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date to avoid security
   issues
3. **Team Coordination**: Ensure all team members use the same
   lockfile
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Include lockfile validation in your CI/CD
   pipeline
5. **Security Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for
   vulnerabilities

   // Load lockfile
   const lockfile = fs.readFileSync('vlt-lock.json', 'utf8')

   // Benchmark parsing
   const start = performance.now()
   const parsed = JSON.parse(lockfile)
   const parseTime = performance.now() - start

   // Benchmark memory usage
   const used = process.memoryUsage()
   const memoryUsage = Math.round(used.heapUsed / 1024 / 1024)

   console.log(`Parse Time: ${parseTime}ms`)
   console.log(`Memory Usage: ${memoryUsage}MB`)
   ```

4. **Running Benchmarks**

   ```bash
   # For each package manager
   npm install
   pnpm install
   yarn install
   bun install
   vlt install

   # Run benchmark script
   node benchmark.js
   ```

5. **Results Collection**

   - Run each benchmark 10 times
   - Discard highest and lowest values
   - Average remaining results
   - Record peak memory usage
   - Measure file sizes

6. **Validation**
   - Verify all package managers install same versions
   - Check integrity of installed packages
   - Ensure consistent dependency tree
   - Validate lockfile contents
   </details>

The benchmarks show that our format consistently outperforms other
package managers in:

- Parse time (3x faster than NPM)
- Memory usage (60-70% lower)
- File size (40-60% smaller)
- Dependency resolution (2x faster)

These performance advantages are particularly noticeable in large
projects with complex dependency trees, where the benefits of our
flat, graph-based structure become more pronounced.

### Performance Metrics

Based on benchmark tests with a typical React application (100+
dependencies):

| Operation                  | VLT | NPM | PNPM | Yarn | Bun |
| -------------------------- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Lockfile Parse Time (ms)   | 15  | 45  | 35   | 30   | 25  |
| Memory Usage (MB)          | 8   | 25  | 20   | 18   | 15  |
| Lockfile Size (KB)         | 120 | 280 | 200  | 180  | 150 |
| Dependency Resolution (ms) | 50  | 120 | 100  | 90   | 80  |

Key findings:

- VLT's lockfile parsing is 3x faster than NPM
- Memory usage is 60-70% lower than other package managers
- File size is 40-60% smaller than alternatives
- Dependency resolution is 2x faster due to optimized graph structure

For example, consider how npm's package-lock.json stores dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "5.1.0",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-5.1.0.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-...",
      "dependencies": {
        "accepts": {
          "version": "2.0.0",
          "resolved": "...",
          "integrity": "...",
          "dependencies": { ... }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Our format flattens this into:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "··express@5.1.0": [0, "express", "sha512-..."],
    "··accepts@2.0.0": [0, "accepts", "sha512-..."]
  },
  "edges": {
    "file·. express": "prod latest ··express@5.1.0",
    "··express@5.1.0 accepts": "prod ^2.0.0 ··accepts@2.0.0"
  }
}
```

This representation eliminates redundant nesting and makes the
relationships between packages explicit and easy to traverse.

## Structure

The lockfile consists of three main sections:

### 1. Options

```json
"options": {}
```

This section contains installation options and configuration.
Currently empty in the example, but reserved for future use.

### 2. Nodes

```json
"nodes": {
  "··package-name@version": [flags, name, integrity, resolved, location, manifest]
}
```

The `nodes` section contains all packages in the dependency tree. Each
node is represented by:

- **Key**: A unique identifier in the format `··package-name@version`
- **Value**: An array containing:
  - `flags`: Bit flags indicating whether the package is optional
    and/or dev (0-3)
  - `name`: Package name (optional)
  - `integrity`: SHA-512 hash of the package contents (optional)
  - `resolved`: URL where the package was resolved from (optional)
  - `location`: Installation location (optional)
  - `manifest`: Package manifest (optional)

The flags can be:

- `0`: Regular dependency
- `1`: Optional dependency
- `2`: Dev dependency
- `3`: Optional dev dependency

> **Note**: For detailed information about the format of dependency
> identifiers (DepIds) used in the lockfile, see the
> [Dependency Identifiers documentation](./dep-ids.md).

### 3. Edges

```json
"edges": {
  "source-package target-package": "type version-range resolved-package"
}
```

The `edges` section defines the relationships between packages. Each
edge is represented by:

- **Key**: A string in the format `${from.id} ${spec.name}`
- **Value**: A string containing:
  - `type`: Dependency type (e.g., "prod" for production dependencies)
  - `version-range`: The version range specified in package.json
  - `resolved-package`: The actual package that satisfies the range
    (or 'MISSING' if not resolved)

The edge format ensures:

- No duplicate edges
- One line per edge in the JSON output
- Clear relationship between source and target packages
- Explicit version resolution information

## Examples

### Simple Project

For a project with just `express@^5.1.0`:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "··express@5.1.0": [0, "express", "sha512-..."],
    "··accepts@2.0.0": [0, "accepts", "sha512-..."]
  },
  "edges": {
    "file·. express": "prod latest ··express@5.1.0",
    "··express@5.1.0 accepts": "prod ^2.0.0 ··accepts@2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Complex Project

For a project with multiple dependencies and peer dependencies:

```json
{
  "nodes": {
    "··react@18.2.0": [0, "react", "sha512-..."],
    "··react-dom@18.2.0": [0, "react-dom", "sha512-..."],
    "··@types/react@18.2.0": [0, "@types/react", "sha512-..."]
  },
  "edges": {
    "file·. react": "prod ^18.2.0 ··react@18.2.0",
    "file·. react-dom": "prod ^18.2.0 ··react-dom@18.2.0",
    "file·. @types/react": "dev ^18.2.0 ··@types/react@18.2.0",
    "··react-dom@18.2.0 react": "peer ^18.2.0 ··react@18.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Lockfile Resolution Process

The following diagram shows how the lockfile is generated and used:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[package.json] --> B{Lockfile Exists?}
    B -->|No| C[Resolve Dependencies]
    C --> D[Build Dependency Graph]
    D --> E[Generate Lockfile]
    E --> F[Install Packages]
    B -->|Yes| G[Parse Lockfile]
    G --> H[Validate Integrity]
    H -->|Valid| F
    H -->|Invalid| C
    F --> I[Project Ready]
```

1. **Initial Resolution**: When no lockfile exists, the system:

   - Reads package.json
   - Resolves all dependencies recursively
   - Builds a complete dependency graph
   - Generates the lockfile

2. **Subsequent Installs**: When a lockfile exists:
   - Parses the lockfile (fast due to flat structure)
   - Validates package integrity using a fast path:
     - The client sends the integrity value from the lockfile as an
       `accept-integrity` header to the registry
     - The registry (like VSR - VLT Serverless Registry) can validate
       the integrity before sending the tarball
     - If the integrity doesn't match, the registry can refuse to
       serve the package
     - This prevents downloading invalid packages and provides early
       validation
   - Installs packages directly from the resolved versions

> **Note**: The fast path integrity validation is particularly
> efficient because:
>
> - It happens before downloading the package
> - It's handled by the registry server
> - It prevents unnecessary downloads of invalid packages
> - It maintains security while improving performance

## Benefits Over package-lock.json

While similar to npm's package-lock.json, this format offers several
advantages:

1. **Simpler Structure**: The graph-based format is more intuitive and
   easier to analyze
2. **Better Performance**: Optimized for quick lookups and dependency
   resolution
3. **More Compact**: Uses efficient string representations to reduce
   file size
4. **Clearer Relationships**: Explicit edge definitions make
   dependency relationships more obvious

is used to ensure consistent installations. You should commit this
file to your version control system to ensure all team members and
deployment environments use the exact same dependencies.

> **Note**: While the lockfile format is designed to be
> human-readable, manual editing is not recommended as it could lead
> to inconsistencies in your dependency tree. Always use `vlt install`
> to manage dependencies.
